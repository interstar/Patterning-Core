## Welcome to Patterning

Patterning is a Clojure / ClojureScript library to make certain kinds of decorative patterns. It's opinionated about how to produce patterns and about the kinds of patterns to produce.

But it's the easiest way to generate what it does.

### Quick Example

----
:patterning

(let
 [triangles
  (clock-rotate 5 ; we are making 5 copies of a pattern in a circle
   (poly
    0.5 0.5 ; centre of the polygon
    0.3 ; radius 
    3 ; the number of sides of this poly, it's a triangle
    {:stroke (p-color 255 100 100), :stroke-weight 2})) ; the colour.
  pentagon
  (poly 0 0 0.7 5 {:stroke (p-color 0 0 255), :stroke-weight 2})] ; this makes a blue pentagon
 (checked-layout 6 (repeat pentagon) (repeat triangles))) ; we layout a "checker-board" of alternating pentagons and bouquets of triangles
